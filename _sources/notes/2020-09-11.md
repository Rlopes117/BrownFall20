# Class 2: intro to notebooks and python

Agenda:
1. review Data Science
1. `jupyter` notebooks
1. `python`: conditionals and functions

+++
## Jupyter Notebooks

To launch a Jupyter notebook, in your anaconda prompt on Windows or terminal on Linux or Mac:

```
cd dir/you/want/to/work/in
jupyter notebook
```


A Jupyter notebook has two modes. When you first open, it is in command mode. The border is blue in command mode.

![screenshot of a code cell in command mode](../img/command_mode.png)

When you press a key in command mode it works like a shortcut. For example `p` shows the command search menu.

![screenshot of the command menu](../img/command_menu.png)




If you press `enter` (or `return`)  or click on the cell it changes to edit mode. The border is green in edit mode

![screenshot of a code cell in edit mode](../img/code_cell.png)


Type code or markdown into boxes called cells. There are two type of cells that we will used: code and markdown. You can change that in command mode with `y` for code and `m` for markdown or on the cell type menu at the top of the notebook.

You can treat markdown cells like plain text, or use special formatting. Here is a [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

+++

Code cells can run like a calculator. If there is a value returned by the last
line of a cell, it will be displayed.

```{code-cell} ipython3
4+5
```

For example, when we assign, python "returns" `None` so there is no output from this cell

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = 9
```
But this one does display the value of the cell
```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
b = 4
b
```

````{margin}
```{note}
Here in class we changed the value of `a` above and noted that the new value is shows here, but not in the previous cell that had ouput the value of `a`
```

````

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
```
## Getting Help in Python and Jupyter

The standard way to get help in the help function

```{margin}
Note that these are green in the jupyter notebook because they're python reserved words.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(print)
```
There are two special ways to get help in Jupyter, one dynamically while you're
working and one that stays displayed for a while

Python comments are indicated by the `#` symbol.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print() # shift +tab to view help
```
That will look like this:
![screenshot of the docstring from shift+tab help](../img/shift_tab_help.png)

Press tab twice for the longer version.

A Question mark puts it in a popup window that stays until you close it

```{code-cell} ipython3
print?
```
![screenshot of the docstring from ? help](../img/qmark_help.png)

This means you can then use the displayed help to remember how to call the function

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(a,b, 'hello',sep='-')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a
b
```
## If Statements

:::{warning}
if the _concept_ of an `if` in programming is new to you, you should talk to Dr.
Brown. Basic programming is a prerequisite to this course, we're *reviewing*
basic ideas but only at a level of detail to serve as a reminder.
:::

The synta
```{code-cell} ipython3
if a >b:
    print('greater')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
if b > a:
    print('greater')
```
```{tip}
this is updated to include things that were skipped in class and discussed after
the breakouts
```
You can check the contents of a string with the `in` keyword

````{margin}
```{tip}
`in` works for all lists, we'll learn more about that next week
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'sarah'
if 'a' in name:
    print(name, 'has an a')
```

if we copy and change the name we get no output

```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'Beibhinn'
if 'a' in name:
    print(name, 'has an a')
```


## Functions

```{tip}
this is also updated to include things that were skipped in class and discussed after
the breakouts
```
How to write functions in python:
- the `def` keyword starts a function definition
- then the function name
- then the parameters it accepts in `()`
- end that line with a `:`
- the body of the function is spaced over one tab, but Jupyter will do it automatically for you. if it doesn't you might have forgotten the `:`

````{margin}
```{warning}
this is actually not a great function, because the printing is only a *side effect*. It's better to return the output of the function
```
````

```{code-cell} ipython3
def greeting(name):
    '''
    a function that greets the person name by printing

    parameters
    ----------
    name: string
      a name to be greeeted

    Returns
    -------
    nothing
    '''
    print('hello', name)
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
greeting('sarah')
```

A better version of that function might be:

````{margin}
```{tip}
you can append strings with `+`
```
````
```{code-cell} ipython3
def greeting(name):
    '''
    a function that greets the person name by printing

    parameters
    ----------
    name: string
      a name to be greeeted

    Returns
    -------
    nothing
    '''
    return 'hello ' + name
```


```{admonition} Try it Yourself!
Write a function that checks if a string has a space in it and returns "please rename" if there is a space.

Remember a docstring.  Call your function a couple of times to confirm it works.
```

Unhide the cell below to see the answer.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

def check_string(text):
    '''
    this function checks for spaces in text

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : string
      the text to be checked

    Returns
    -------
    None or "please rename"
    '''
    if ' ' in text:
        return "please rename"
```

This is what some calls of the function look lik

```{code-cell} ipython3
check_string("my data.csv")
```

If there's no string we see no output

```{code-cell} ipython3
check_string("my_data.csv")
```

What does python actually return?

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

type(check_string("my_data.csv"))
```

```{toggle}
it returns `None`, which is the python empty/null data type
```
