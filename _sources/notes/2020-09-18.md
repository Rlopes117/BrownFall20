# Class 5: Accessing Data, continued

Today's agenda:

- warm up/ review
- announcements
- working with dataframes
- the power of functions as objects
- (maybe) exploratory data analysis

+++

<!--  ```{admonition} Try it out -->
# Warm up
To do:
1. start a jupyter notbeook
1. check the questin on prismia chat
<!--  ``` -->

+++

Read the tables off of the [syllabus course map]('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html) page with `read_html` and make a list of the shapes of all of the tables on the page. Save the output to a variable and paste the *value* of that variable as your answer to the question.

```{code-cell} ipython3

import pandas as pd
[df.shape for df in pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html')]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brownsarahm/python-socialsci-files/master/data/SAFI_clean.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.to_csv('safi_clean.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.to_csv('data/safi_clean.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df2= pd.read_csv('data/safi_clean.csv')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df2.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.to_csv('data/safi_clean.csv',index=False)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df3 = pd.read_csv('data/safi_clean.csv')
safi_df3.head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['village']
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.loc[3]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.loc[3:5]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.loc[:4]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.loc[::5]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['village'].head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.village.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df[['village','no_membrs','years_liv']].head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
columns_of_interest = ['village','no_membrs','years_liv']
safi_df[columns_of_interest].head(2)
```

## Functions are objects

```{code-cell} ipython3
syllabus_df_list =  pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
view_rows = {0: lambda df: print(df.head()),
            1: lambda df: print(df.tail())}
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for df in syllabus_df_list:
    num_row = len(df)
    view_rows[num_row%2](df)

```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.describe()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.set_index('key_ID',inplace=True)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.head(2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.describe()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df['rooms'].mean()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
safi_df.plot.scatter('no_membrs','rooms')
```



## After Class Questions

````{dropdown} How can we clean data? what other topics will we cover in this class?

Great Question! We'll get to data cleaning soon. See the [Schedule](schedule).
````

````{dropdown} How does the syntax on the question from prismia today work?

The question was:

> Read the tables off of the [syllabus course map]('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html) page with `read_html` and make a list of the shapes of all of the tables on the page. Save the output to a variable and paste the *value* of that variable as your answer to the question.

And the soluiton was:
```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
[df.shape for df in pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html')]
```

This uses something called a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions), they are a way to make lists, that look a lot like putting a for loop in a list. There are two ways to use them under the hood, as in the linked documentation, the one above is considered more pythonic, because it is more concise.

The `[]` define a list, we can do that with anything, for example my zoom meetings today were:


```{code-cell} ipython3
todays_meetings = ['writing QEM','CSC310', 'office hours']
todays_meetings
```
Note that the last line is there to display what happened, but it would work without.

We could get the same output using [`append`](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists) and a regular `for` loop. That  syntax would look like:

```{code-cell} ipython3
shape_list = []

for df in pd.read_html('https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/syllabus/course_map.html'):
    shape_list.append(df.shape)

shape_list
```

````


````{dropdown} Where I can go to find a list of all the syntax.

A *list* of all the syntax might be hard to find, but the [course textbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is free online with a lot of reference material in it.

A lot of what we did today is in [Data Indexing and Selection](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.02-data-indexing-and-selection.html)

Also, the class notes are listed after each class on this website.

Also, you can get help from within a notebook and the [pandas User guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) has full details.
