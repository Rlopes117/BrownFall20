The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our students. At this uncertain time, those concerns include minimizing the potential spread of COVID-19 within our community. While the university has worked this summer to create a healthy learning environment for all, it is up to all of us to ensure our campus stays that way.

As members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take precautions to keep themselves and others safe. Students are required to comply with Rhode Island state laws, including the Rhode Island Executive Orders related to health and safety, ordinances, regulations, and guidance adopted by the University as it relates to public health crises, such as COVID-19.

An addendum on policies and guidelines concerning your obligations during this crisis has recently been integrated into the Student Handbook. These obligations include:

- Wearing of face masks by all community members when on a URI campus in the presence of others

- Maintaining physical distancing of at least six feet at all times

- Following state rules on the number of individuals allowed in a group gathering

- Completing a daily health self-assessment also available through the Rhody Connect app before coming to campus
- Submitting to COVID-19 testing as the University monitors the health of our community
- Following the Universityâ€™s quarantine and isolation requirements

If you answer yes to any of the questions on the daily health assessment, do not go to campus.  YOU MUST STAY HOME/IN YOUR ROOM and notify URI Health Services via phone at 401-874-2246 immediately.



If you are already on campus and start to feel ill, you need to remove yourself from the public and notify URI Health Services via phone immediately at 401-874-2246 and go home/back to your room and self-isolate while you await direction from Health Services.


If you are unable to attend class, please notify me at brownsarahm@uri.edu or through the medium we have established for the class. We will work together to ensure that course instruction and work is completed for the semester.
