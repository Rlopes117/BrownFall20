## Tools and Resources

We will use a variety of tools to conduct class and to facilitate your programming.



### BrightSpace

This will be the central location from which you can access all other materials.
Any links that are for private discussion among those enrolled in the course will be available only from Brightspace
This is also where your grades will appear.

### Zoom


This is where we will meet for synchronous class sessions. You will find the link to class zoom sessions on Brightspace.

URI provides all faculty, staff, and students with a paid Zoom account. It *can* run in your browser or on a mobible device, but you will be able to particpate in class best if you download the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) on your computer. Please [log in](https://uri-edu.zoom.us/) and [configure your account](https://uri-edu.zoom.us/profile).  Especially if you will not want to have your camera on during class, please add a photo of yourself to your account so that we can still.

For help, you can access the [instructions provided by IT](https://web.uri.edu/itservicedesk/zoom-at-uri/).

### Prismia chat

Our class link for Prismia chat is available on Brightspace.
We will use this for chatting and in-class understanding checks.

### Course Manual

The course manual will have content including the class policies, scheduling, class notes, assignment information, and additional resources.
This will be linked from Brightspace and available publicly online at [rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/).
Links to the course reference text and code documentation will also be included here in the assignments and class notes.

### GitHub Classroom

You will need a GitHub Account. If you do not already have one, please create one by the first day of class.

### Programming Environment

This a programming course, so you will need a programming environment. In order to complete assignments you need the items listed in the requirements list. The easiest way to meet these requirements is to follow the recommendations below. I will provide instruction assuming that you have followed the recommendations.

Requirements:
- Python with scientific computing packages (numpy, scipy, jupyter, pandas, etc)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- A web browser compatible with Jupyter Notebooks
<!-- - Openrefine -->

Recommendation:
- Install python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- if you use Windows, install Git with [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) ([video instructions](https://youtu.be/339AEqk9c-8)).
- if you use MacOS, install Git with the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.`git --version`

```{note}
all Git instructions will be given as instructions for the command line interface and GitHub specific instructions via the web interface. You may choose to use GitHub desktop or built in IDE tools, but the instructional team may not be able to help.
