    "### Principles of Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning happens through practice and feedback. My goal as a teacher is for you to learn. The grading in this course is based on your learning of the material, rather than your completion of the activities that are assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is designed to encourage you to work steadily at learning the material and demonstrating your new knowledge. There are no single points of failure, where you lose points that cannot be recovered. Also, you cannot cram anything one time and then forget it. The material will build and you have to demonstrate that you retained things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Earning a C in this class is intended to be easier than typical grading. I expect everyone to get at least a C.\n",
    "<!-- , which means you have a general understanding of Data Science and could have an educated conversation about all of the topics we cover. -->\n",
    "- Earning a B in this class is intended to be very accessible, you can make a lot of mistakes along the way as you learn, as long as you learn by the end.\n",
    "<!-- Earning a B means that you could solve simple data science problems on your own and complete parts of more complex problems as instructed by, for example, a supervisor in an internship or entry level job.  -->\n",
    "- Earning an A in this class will be challenging, but is possible even with making mistakes while you learn.\n",
    "<!-- Earning an A means that you could solve moderately complex problems independently and discus the quality of others' data science solutions.  -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading this way also is more amenable to the fact that there are correct and incorrect ways to do things, but there is not always a single correct answer to a realistic data science problem. Your work will be assessed on whether or not it demonstrates your learning of the targeted skills. You will also receive feedback on how to improve."

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 15 skills that you will be graded on in this course.\n",
    "While learning these skills, you will work through a progression of learning.\n",
    "Your grade will be based on earning 45 achievements that are organized into 15 skill groups with 3 levels for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "These map onto letter grades roughly as follows:\n",
    "  - If you achieve level 1 in all of the skills, you will earn at least a C in the course.\n",
    "  - To earn a B, you must earn all of the level 1 and level 2 achievements.\n",
    "  - To earn an A, you must earn all of the achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have at least three opportunities to earn every level 2 achievement.\n",
    "You will have at least two opportunities to earn every level 3 achievement.\n",
    "You will have three *types* of opportunities to demonstrate your current skill level: participation, assignments, and a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each level of achievement corresponds to a phase in your learning of the skill:\n",
    "  - To earn level 1 achievements, you will need to demonstrate basic awareness of the required concepts and know approximately what to do, but you may need specific instructions of which things to do or to look up examples to modify every step of the way. You can earn level 1 achievements in class, assignments, or portfolio submissions.\n",
    "  - To earn level 2 achievements you will need to demonstrate understanding of the concepts and the ability to apply them with instruction after earning the level 1 achievement for that skill. You can earn level 2 achievements in assignments or portfolio submissions.\n",
    "  - To earn level 3 achievements you will be required to consistently execute each skill and demonstrate deep understanding of the course material, after achieving level 2 in that skill. You can earn level 3 achievements only through your portfolio submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "While attending synchronous class sessions, there will be understanding checks and in class exercises.\n",
    "Completing in class exercises and correctly answering questions in class can earn level 1 achievements.\n",
    "In class questions will be administered through the classroom chat platform Prismia.chat; these records will be used to update your skill progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "For your learning to progress and earn level 2 achievements, you must practice with the skills outside of class time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments will each evaluate certain skills. After your assignment is reviewed, you will get qualitative feedback on your work, and an assessment of your demonstration of the targeted skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portfolio Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "To earn level 3 achievements, you will build a portfolio consisting of reflections, challenge problems, and longer analyses over the course of the semester.\n",
    "You will submit your portfolio for review 4 times.\n",
    "The first two will cover the skills taught up until 1 week before the submission deadline.\n",
    "<!-- The first portfolio check will cover skills FIXME.\n",
    "The second portfolio check will cover skills FIXME. -->\n",
    "The third and fourth portfolio checks will cover all of the skills.\n",
    "The fourth will be due during finals. This means that, if you have achieved mastery of all of the skills by the 3rd portfolio check, you do not need to submit the fourth one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio prompts will be given throughout the class, some will be strucutred questions, others may be questions that arise in class, for which there is not time to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TLDR\n",
    "\n",
    "You *could* earn a C through in class participation alone, if you make nearly zero mistakes. To earn a B, you must complete assignments and participate in class. To earn an A you must participate, complete assignments, and build a portfolio."
