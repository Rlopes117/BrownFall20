# Formatting Tips

Your portfolio is a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). This means a few things:
- it uses [myst markdown](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html)
- it will run and compile Jupyter notebooks

This page will cover a few basic tips.

## File Naming

It is best practice to name files without spaces. 


## Configurations

Things like the menus and links at the top are controlled as [settings](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html), in `_config.yml`

## Links

Markdown syntax for links

```
[text to show](path/or/url)
```
