<h3>Programming Environment<a class="headerlink" href="#programming-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This a programming course, so you will need a programming environment. In order to complete assignments you need the items listed in the requirements list. The easiest way to meet these requirements is to follow the recommendations below. I will provide instruction assuming that you have followed the recommendations.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Python with scientific computing packages (numpy, scipy, jupyter, pandas, etc)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git</a></p></li>
<li><p>A web browser compatible with Jupyter Notebooks</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- - Openrefine -->
<p>Recommendation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Install python via <a class="reference external" href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a></p></li>
<li><p>if you use Windows, install Git with <a class="reference external" href="https://gitforwindows.org/">GitBash</a> (<a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/339AEqk9c-8">video instructions</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>if you use MacOS, install Git with the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">--version</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>all Git instructions will be given as instructions for the command line interface and GitHub specific instructions via the web interface. You may choose to use GitHub desktop or built in IDE tools, but the instructional team may not be able to help.</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation</p></li>
<li><p>Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized possession or access to exams</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized communication during exams</p></li>
<li><p>Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student</p></li>
<li><p>Taking an exam for another student</p></li>
<li><p>Altering or attempting to alter grades</p></li>
<li><p>The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams</p></li>
<li><p>Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references</p></li>
<li><p>Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors</p></li>

<h3>URI COVID-19 Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#uri-covid-19-statement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our students. At this uncertain time, those concerns include minimizing the potential spread of COVID-19 within our community. While the university has worked this summer to create a healthy learning environment for all, it is up to all of us to ensure our campus stays that way.</p>
<p>As members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take precautions to keep themselves and others safe. Students are required to comply with Rhode Island state laws, including the Rhode Island Executive Orders related to health and safety, ordinances, regulations, and guidance adopted by the University as it relates to public health crises, such as COVID-19.</p>
<p>An addendum on policies and guidelines concerning your obligations during this crisis has recently been integrated into the Student Handbook. These obligations include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Wearing of face masks by all community members when on a URI campus in the presence of others</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining physical distancing of at least six feet at all times</p></li>
<li><p>Following state rules on the number of individuals allowed in a group gathering</p></li>
<li><p>Completing a daily health self-assessment also available through the Rhody Connect app before coming to campus</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting to COVID-19 testing as the University monitors the health of our community</p></li>
<li><p>Following the University’s quarantine and isolation requirements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you answer yes to any of the questions on the daily health assessment, do not go to campus.  YOU MUST STAY HOME/IN YOUR ROOM and notify URI Health Services via phone at 401-874-2246 immediately.</p>
<p>If you are already on campus and start to feel ill, you need to remove yourself from the public and notify URI Health Services via phone immediately at 401-874-2246 and go home/back to your room and self-isolate while you await direction from Health Services.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend class, please notify me at brownsarahm&#64;uri.edu or through the medium we have established for the class. We will work together to ensure that course instruction and work is completed for the semester.</p>
