## Syllabus FAQ

##### How much does assignment x, class participation, or a portfolio check weigh in my grade?
```{toggle}
There is no specific weight for any activities, because your grade is based on earning achievements for the skills listed in the skills rubric.

However, if you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) assignments or portfolios, the maximum grade you can earn is a C.
If you do not submit (or earn no achievements from) your portfolio, the maximum grade you can earn is a B.

##### Can I submit this assignment late if ...?
```{toggle}
No, late assignments are not accepted. Your grade is based on the skills, not the assignments. All skills are assessed in at least two assignments, so missing any one will not hurt your grade.
