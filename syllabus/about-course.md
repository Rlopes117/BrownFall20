### About this course

Data science exists at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and machine
learning. That means writing programs to access and manipulate data so that it becomes
available for analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques is at the core of
data science. Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich
data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth
constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to
aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and
communicate the data insights/findings.

This course provides a survey of data science. Topics include data driven programming
in Python; data sets, file formats and meta-data; descriptive statistics, data visualization,
and foundations of predictive data modeling and machine learning; accessing web data
and databases; distributed data management. You will work on weekly substantial
programming problems such as accessing data in database and visualize it or build
machine learning models of a given data set.


Basic programming skills (CSC201 or CSC211) are a prerequisite to this course. This course is a prerequisite course to machine learning, where you learn how machine learning algorithms work. In this course, we will start with a very fast review of basic programming ideas, since you've already done that before. We will learn how to *use* machine learning algorithms to do data science, but not how to *build* machine learning algorithms, we'll use packages that implement the algorithms for us.

### About this semester

This semester is a lot of new things for all of us. This course will be completely online all semester, so we will get to use a single format all semester. However, I recognize that the time after Thanksgiving break may be different for many of you. In light of that, we will cover all of the most important topics and you will have the opportunity to achieve all of the course learning outcomes before Thanksgiving. The material in the last two weeks of the semester will be more advanced, likely interesting and definitely useful material, but if your ability to participate in class is less at that time, it will not hurt your grade.
<!-- if after that break the change in circumstance allows you to focus less on coursework that will not hurt your grade. -->
