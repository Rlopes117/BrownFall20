### About this course

Data science exists at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and machine
learning. That means writing programs to access and manipulate data so that it becomes
available for analysis using statistical and machine learning techniques is at the core of
data science. Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich
data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth
constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to
aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and
communicate the data insights/findings.

This course provides a survey of data science. Topics include data driven programming
in Python; data sets, file formats and meta-data; descriptive statistics, data visualization,
and foundations of predictive data modeling and machine learning; accessing web data
and databases; distributed data management. You will work on weekly substantial
programming problems such as accessing data in database and visualize it or build
machine learning models of a given data set.

Basic programming skills (CSC201 or CSC211) are a prerequisite to this course and this course is a prerequisite course to machine learning. In this course, we will start with a very fast review of basic programming ideas, since you've already done that before. We will how to use machine learning algorithms to do data science, but not how to build machine learning algorithms, we'll use packages.

### About this semester

This semester is a lot of new things for all of us. We will be running this course completely online all semester, so we will get to use a single format all semester. I still recognize that the time after that break may be different for many of you. We will cover all of the most important things before that point and you will have the opportunity to achieve all of the course learning outcomes by then. The material after will be greatly useful, but if after that break the change in circumstance allows you to focus less on coursework that will not hurt your grade.

Name: Dr. Sarah Brown
Office hours:  TBA via zoom, link in Brightspace


Dr. Brown is a new Assistant Professor of Computer Science, who does research on how social context changes machine learning. Dr. Brown earned a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University, completed a postdoctoral fellowship at University of California Berkeley, and worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University before joining URI. At Brown university, Dr. Brown taught the Data and Society course for the Master's in Data Science Program.
