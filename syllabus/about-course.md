### About this course

This course aims to

Basic programming skills are a prerequisite to this course and this course is a prerequisite course to machine learning. In this course, we will start with a very fast review of basic programming ideas, since you've already done that before. We will how to use machine learning algorithms to do data science, but not how to build machine learning algorithms, we'll use packages.

### About this semester

This semester is a lot of new things for all of us. We will be running this course completely online all semester, so we will get to use a single format all semester. I still recognize that the time after that break may be different for many of you. This course will not have a required final and all assignments after that point will help improve your grade, but if you cannot complete them, it will not hurt your grade.
