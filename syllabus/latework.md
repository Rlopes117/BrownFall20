# Late work

No late work will be graded. You may visit office hours to discuss assignments that you did not complete on time to get feedback and check your own understanding, but they will not count toward skill demonstration.

Every skill will be assessed through more than one assignment, so missing assignments occasionally *may* not hurt your grade. If you do not submit any assignments that cover a given skill, you may demonstrate competency in that skill through a portfolio check, but you will not be able to demonstrate mastery in that skill.
